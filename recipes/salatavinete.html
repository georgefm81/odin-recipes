        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Salata de Vinete (eggplant salad) is a very popular food 
            in Romania and one of my most favorite Romanian dishes. It is actually a starter,
             with a soft and creamy texture that makes it quite addictive. </p>
        <p>In Romania this is a seasonal dish, prepared mainly in summer time, when you can 
            find fresh eggplants on the market. But some people would preserve the grilled 
            eggplants and make the salad in other seasons as well. It is very easy to prepare. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The eggplants need to be grilled on the barbecue (10-12 min. on each side) until 
                the peel gets slightly burned and the flesh is soft.</li>
            <li>The eggplants need to be poke it with a fork before cooking, to let the steam out. </li>
            <li>When they are cooked you peel off the black peel and lay them flat to drain (approx. 12 hrs), 
                then chop them finely with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>After that you mix them with onion (chopped), salt, and a spoon of mayonnaise. </li>
            <li>You can add 3-4 spoons of olive oil a bit at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon.</li>
        </ol>
